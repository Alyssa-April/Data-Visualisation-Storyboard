# Data-Visualisation-Storyboard
For this project (for my Data Visualisation and Communication subject during my Master's), I was asked to find a unique topic to investigate. I had to build a storyboard for a documentary on the topic, with 10 frames.  I chose to do my project on tennis as I enjoy watching this sport.
